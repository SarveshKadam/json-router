# JSON-Based Router

You can view the [Live App](https://json-router.netlify.app/).

## Features ‚≠ê

‚ö°Ô∏è JSON Based on scalable routing\
‚ö°Ô∏è Role-Based Routing\
‚ö°Ô∏è Breadcrumbs with active link\
‚ö°Ô∏è Includes Reusable Components\

## Technologies used üõ†Ô∏è

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript Library
- [React Router Dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - Client-side routing
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Programming language that builds on JavaScript

## Deployment üì¶

I used [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host the react app

## Run Locally

`npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Areas to Improve

1. Use API to fetch the list of Projects and use the `loader` and `useLoaderData` features of react-router-dom.
2. For Demo Purposes, have provided a checkbox to sign in as an Admin user, but we can implement authorization with a backend service.
